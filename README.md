This is a very Basic DeepLearning Project to try out image-classification from scratch.

if  you wanna try out you can do it in google colab, just create a account on kaggle, go to settings > accounts > create a new a API key 

You will get an kaggle.json, just upload this kaggle.json file in google collab, and done.

For Testing the model you will require some test images of cat and dog, just change the path of your test image 

### By this you can train any image classifier using TensorFlow and Keras
